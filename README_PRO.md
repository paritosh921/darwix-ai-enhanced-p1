- **Language Support**: Automatic detection or use provided examples for Python, JavaScript, Java

### 2. Input Format
The application expects JSON input with two keys:

```json
{
  "code_snippet": "def get_active_users(users):\n    results = []\n    for u in users:\n        if u.is_active == True and u.profile_complete == True:\n            results.append(u)\n    return results",
  "review_comments": [
    "This is inefficient. Don't loop twice conceptually.",
    "Variable 'u' is a bad name.",
    "Boolean comparison '== True' is redundant."
  ]
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Workflow
1. **Load Examples**: Try Python, JavaScript, or Java examples with one click
2. **Real-time Preview**: See parsed data with language detection and severity analysis

## üìä Enhanced Example Output

With the **Senior Developer** persona, the tool generates empathetic feedback like:

```markdown
# üìù Empathetic Code Review Report

**Language:** Python | **Reviewer Persona:** Senior Developer | **Overall Quality Score:** 6.3/10

---
### Analysis of Comment: "This is inefficient. Don't loop twice conceptually."

**Positive Rephrasing:** Great start on the logic here! In my experience with large datasets, we can make this more efficient by leveraging Python's built-in optimizations.

**The 'Why':** Performance becomes critical at scale. List comprehensions in Python are not only more readable but also faster because they're implemented in C under the hood, avoiding the overhead of repeated function calls.

**Suggested Improvement:**
```python
def get_active_users(users):
    return [user for user in users if user.is_active and user.profile_complete]
```

**Performance Impact:** ~2-3x faster for large datasets, reduced memory footprint

## üìä Quality Metrics
- **Readability**: 6.0/10
- **Performance**: 5.5/10  
- **Maintainability**: 7.0/10
- **Best Practices**: 6.5/10
